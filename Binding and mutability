Binding and mutability
🌟 A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.

// Fix the error below with least amount of modification to the code
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5; // Uninitialized but used, ERROR !
    let y: i32; // Uninitialized but also unused, only a Warning !

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
}

🌟 Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.

// Fill the blanks in the code to make it compile
fn main() {
    let mut x  = 1;
    x+= 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    println!("x = {}", x);
}


Scope
A scope is the range within the program for which the item is valid.


// Fix the error below with least amount of modification
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    {
        let y: i32 = 5;
        println!("Inner scope value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    
    println!("Outer scope value of x is {}", x); 
}

4.🌟🌟


// Fix the error with the use of define_x
fn main() {
    let x =  "hello";
    println!("{}, world", x); 
}

fn define_x() {
    let x = "hello";
}

Shadowing
You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, here we can say the first one is shadowed by the second one.
5.🌟🌟

// Only modify `assert_eq!` to make the `println!` work(print `42` in terminal)
fn main() {
    let x: i32;
    {
       
         x = 12;
    
    }

    assert_eq!(x, 12);
    println!("x = {}", x); // Prints "42".
}

6.🌟🌟

// Remove a line in the code to make it compile
fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 1;
    x = 7;
 // shadowing and re-binding removed problematic line
    x += 3;


    let y = 4;
    let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; 

    println!("Success!");
}


Unused variables
7.Fix the warning below with :
🌟 Only one solution
🌟🌟 Two distinct solutions

fn main() {
    let x = 1; 
     println!("{}", x);
}

// Warning: unused variable: `x`

Destructuring
8. 🌟🌟 We can use a pattern with let to destructure a tuple to separate variables.


// Fix the error below with least amount of modification
fn main() {
    let (mut x, y) = (1, 2);
    x += 2;

    assert_eq!(x, 3);
    assert_eq!(y, 2);

    println!("Success!");
}

Destructuring assignments
Introduced in Rust 1.59: You can now use tuple, slice, and struct patterns as the left-hand side of an assignment.

9.🌟🌟

fn main() {
    let mut x = 1;  // зовнішній mutable x

    {
        let x = 2; // shadowing
        println!("Inner x = {}", x);
    }

    x += 3; // змінюємо зовнішній x

    assert_eq!(x, 4);
    println!("Success!");
}
